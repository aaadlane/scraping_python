# SCRAPPING WIKILEAKS AND STORING INFORMATION ON MYSQL

this a project we did in my formation, the instructions were to scrap a website related to a database and dockerized for future usage.

## Usage
There is a scrapper Class that gets the website infos and a MySQL class to create the DB and insert querys inside.

You juste have to use the docker compose to run the script with the command ```docker-compose up```

Dont forget to setup an < .env > file for you credentials. The logs will get you the informations you need as well.
