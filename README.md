# scraping_python_MySQL

this a project we did in my formation, the instructions were to scrap a website related to a database and dockerized for future usage.
There is a scrapper Class that gets the website infos and a MySQL class to create the DB and insert querys inside.
You juste have to use the docker compose to run the script.
Dont forget to setup an < .env > file for you credentials. The logs will get you the informations you need as well.
